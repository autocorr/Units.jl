Overview
========
The `Units.jl` provides a framework for manipulating units and physical
quantities in Julia. `Units.jl` uses the type system for performant execution
while permitting flexible user-defined units. This documentation is
currently under construction.

`Units.jl` aims to include the following features:

* SI and CGS units
* User defined units
* Unit conversion
* Prefixes and unit abbreviations
* Dimensional analysis
* Physical constants defined from NISTs CODATA
* Intelligent conversion to preferred units
* CGS electromagnetic unit systems

Other Projects
--------------
Other active projects that support unit analysis in Julia include
[Physical.jl](https://github.com/ggggggggg/Physical.jl) and
[SIUnits.jl](https://github.com/Keno/SIUnits.jl).
